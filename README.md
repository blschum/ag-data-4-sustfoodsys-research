# Cleaning USDA NASS Census and Survey Data, Formatted in Quick Stats

USDA NASS Quick Stats data exploration, a companion product for 'Implications of U.S. agricultural data practices for sustainable food systems research' published in *Nature Food*, Feb. 2023. doi forthcoming.

**Note**: In this exploration, we utilize manual data query and download from the Quick Stats database to represent the most accessible option. We note that the NASS API provides data users with software-mediated access to the NASS servers, but also believe it effectively limits access to those users with the coding expertise required to query the interface. Thus, we do not explore API-mediated data query and download in this document.

### Data ethics statement
We believe in open data science and in making research more reproducible; if you run into issues with any of our code, or criticisms, please reach out to blschum on GitHub to fix/discuss them.
